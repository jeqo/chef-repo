  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook is used to configure a system with Oracle Express Edition 11g.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nYou must download the RPM in advance from Oracle yourself and accept the EULA. The RPM must be placed on a server that can serve it up over HTTP, and you must set the attribute `node['oracle-xe']['url']` with that URL.\n\n## Platforms\n\nOracle Express Edition 11g is only supported on:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\n\nand variants (Oracle Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific)\n\n# Usage\n\nInclude the default recipe in your run list after setting the URL attribute.\n\n# Attributes\n\n* `node['oracle-xe']['url']` - The URL where you've placed the Oracle 11g Express Edition RPM.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['http-port']` - The port where you want the HTTP interface to be listening.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['tnslsnr-port']` - The port where you want the TNS listener to be listening.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['oracle-password']`  - The password for the SYS and SYSTEM accounts.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['start-lsnr-on-boot']`  - Whether to start the TNS listener on bootup.\n\n# Recipes\n\nThe default recipe installs Oracle 11g Express Edition.\n\nRoadmap and Bugs\n================\n\n* Figure out why the response file doesn't actually seem to set SYS and SYSTEM passwords properly.\n* Check Ohai data before doing anything to ensure the system has sufficient resources (cores, swap, memory) before running the RPM and having Oracle's installer fail.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n- Author:: Julian C.
